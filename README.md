Thousand Language Morphology Database
=====================================

This project is part of Greg Baker's postgrad studies.

Greg's claim is that p-adic metrics are ideally suited to various natural
language processing machine learning tasks -- better than Euclidean metrics.

One of the tasks where p-adics are likely to be helpful is in grammar morphology:
deducing from a very small number of examples how the language changes the forms
of words to represent their roles in a sentence.


This repo will contain word-form pairs from 1000 languages.


Building from scratch
---------------------

This not complete yet.

1. `git clone git@github.com:OpenText-org/GNT_annotation_v1.0.git`

2. Run `parse_verses.ipynb`

3. (More to come)
